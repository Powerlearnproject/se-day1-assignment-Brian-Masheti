**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**
1960s - The "Software Crisis": All of the original software projects collapsed due to cost overruns, schedule slips, and poor quality. This established the foundation of the field of software engineering. The discipline of structured programming developed as a solution to the management of complexity.
1970s - Structured Programming and the Waterfall Model: The techniques of structured programming (such as dividing code into modules) became widely adopted. The linear and sequential software development technique known as the Waterfall model appeared as a process model.
1990s - Object-Oriented Programming and Agile Methodologies: The 1990s' fad was object-oriented programming with an emphasis on modularity and code reusability. The Scrum and XP agile methods appeared in response to the failures of the Waterfall approach with an emphasis put on iterative development and flexibility.


**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of seven key phases: planning, requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance. These phases guide the software development process from idea to continuous improvement.
  - Planning: Defines the software’s purpose, scope, and feasibility. Key documents like the project plan and software requirement specification (SRS) are created.
  - Requirements analysis: Identifies user needs through data collection and analysis, resulting in a requirements specification document.
  - Design: Establishes software structure, interface, and functionality, documented in the software design document (SDD).
  - Coding: Developers write the software based on the SDD, with regular code reviews and internal testing.
  - Testing: Identifies bugs through various tests, ensuring functionality and reliability.
  - Deployment: Releases the software using deployment strategies while providing user support.
  - Maintenance: Ensures software longevity through updates, bug fixes, and continuous improvements.

**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**

## Comparison of Waterfall and Agile Methodologies

| Aspect        | Waterfall | Agile |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| **Approach** | Sequential, structured | Iterative, flexible |
| **Phases** | Follows a linear progression: planning → design → development → testing → deployment | Follows short development cycles (sprints) with continuous feedback |
| **Flexibility** | Rigid; changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed | Adaptable; changes can be made at any stage |
| **Documentation** | Extensive documentation before development begins | Less documentation, more focus on working software |
| **Customer Involvement** | Minimal until the product is delivered | Continuous feedback and collaboration with stakeholders |
| **Testing** | Performed after development is complete | Ongoing testing throughout development |
| **Delivery** | Delivered as a complete product at the end | Delivered in increments, allowing for early releases and improvements |

### Appropriate Scenarios

- **Waterfall** is best for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes.  
  - Example: Developing regulatory compliance software where requirements are fixed and documentation is crucial.  

- **Agile** is ideal for projects requiring flexibility, ongoing feedback, and continuous improvement.  
  - Example: Creating a mobile app where user feedback can influence iterative updates and new features.


**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**

**a) Software Developer**
    Writes, tests, and maintains code to build software applications.
    Collaborates with designers and stakeholders to implement features.
    Fixes bugs and optimizes performance.
    Uses version control (e.g., Git) to manage code changes.
    Keeps up with new technologies and best practices.

**b) Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer**
- Designs and executes test plans to identify software defects.
- Automates testing processes using tools like Selenium or JUnit.
- Works with developers to ensure quality standards are met.
- Reports and tracks bugs until resolved.
- Ensures software meets performance, security, and usability standards.

**c) Project Manager (PM)**
- Defines project scope, goals, and timelines.
- Assigns tasks and ensures team members meet deadlines.
- Communicates with stakeholders and manages expectations.
- Identifies and mitigates project risks.
- Monitors progress and ensures the project stays within budget.

**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**

Integrated development environments (IDEs)

IDEs simplify the code with integrated tools within a single interface that enhances efficiency and minimizes errors. The major advantages include:
- Code Editing & Debugging: Syntax highlighting and code completion with built-in debuggers
- Build automation: Makes compiling and execution simpler.
- Project Management: Organizes large project files and project interdependencies.

Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm.

**b) Version Control Systems (VCS)**
VCS follows the code modifications and permits collaborative working and a record of the changes. The primary benefits include:
- Collaboration: Multiple developers with no conflict of interest can work on the project.
- Rollback & Recovery: Recover previous versions if anything goes amiss.
- Branching and merging: Develop features separately and merge them subsequently.

Examples include Git with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket and Apache Sub

**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**
1. Unestablished project infrastructure – Delays occur when the necessary development environments are not set up.
        Solution: Ensure test and pre-production environments are available early.

2. Changing requirements – Constant changes lead to scope creep and inefficiencies.
        Solution: Define a clear project scope, involve users early, and document requirements properly.

3. Quality assurance issues – Rushed development leads to poor code quality.
        Solution: Enforce strict QA processes and best coding practices.

4. Undefined quality standards – Testing may miss defects due to vague standards.
        Solution: Develop a comprehensive test plan covering all requirements.

5. Keeping up with market trends – Lack of modern skills delays project delivery.
        Solution: Continuously update skills and stay informed on new technologies.

6. Design influence challenges – Stakeholder demands can affect system consistency.
        Solution: Maintain a uniform design across platforms.

7. System integration complexities – Third-party and internal system integrations introduce unforeseen issues.
        Solution: Understand end-user needs, research integration frameworks, and conduct thorough testing.

8. Inefficient project management – Poor planning and multitasking reduce productivity.
        Solution: Use project management tools and allocate tasks sequentially.

9. Testing environment limitations – Controlled test settings don’t fully reflect real-world usage.
        Solution: Test software in real-life environments before deployment.

10. Security vulnerabilities – Rising cyber threats make applications vulnerable.
    Solution: Implement security best practices, conduct penetration testing, and use secure coding techniques.


**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**
- Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules.
- Integration Testing: Testing how modules interact with each other.
- System Testing: Testing the entire system as a whole.
- Acceptance Testing: Testing by the customer to ensure the software meets their requirements.   

**#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering**

**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**

**Prompt engineering** is the act of authoring directives for AI models that will yield particular results. Prompt engineering is a collaborative and iterative endeavor that involves the selection of phrases, words, and forms that will instruct the AI


**Benefits of Prompt Engineering**

**1. Increased Developer Control**

Prompt engineering allows the developer to steer the AI interaction with intention and clear context. Well-structured prompts filter the output of the AI and format it correctly. They also keep the AI system away from inappropriate use by restraining inappropriate queries or commands beyond the scope of the AI system, including the generation of inappropriate content within a commercial application.


**2. Enhanced User Experience**

Users get the correct and relevant answers with minimal trial and error. Well-structured prompts help AI get it right the first time and minimize the influence of training data-derived biases. They also help AI better understand the intention of the user with a smaller set of inputs. For instance, a request to paraphrase a judicial document and a media report will get two different results in tone and language although the two prompts might be the same, namely "Paraphrase this document."


**3. Increased Flexibility**

﻿Prompt engineering allows organizations to build adaptable and scale-able AI solutions. Through the development of prompts that prioritize logical connections and general patterns, AI models can be applied within multiple domains. An example of this includes an AI that has been trained with generic prompts that identify inefficiencies and can be applied within multiple business processes and departments and yield the highest returns of use.


**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**
Vague Prompt:_ "Tell me about animals."_
This prompt is extremely broad.  The AI could respond with information about any animal, from ants to elephants, and in any format.

Improved Prompt:  _"Write a short paragraph comparing and contrasting the physical characteristics and habitats of African elephants and Asian elephants.  Focus on their size, tusks, ears, and the types of environments they live in."_

**_Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:_**
- Clarity: It specifies the type of animals (African and Asian elephants).
- Specificity: It defines the specific aspects to focus on (physical characteristics and habitats).
- Conciseness: It avoids unnecessary words and gets straight to the point.
- Format: It requests a specific format (a short paragraph).
- Context: It provides some context by mentioning size, tusks, ears, and environments.

The improved prompt guides the AI towards a much more focused and relevant response. It's more likely to provide the exact information the user is looking for.  By being clear, specific, and concise, the improved prompt demonstrates the core principles of effective prompt engineering.
